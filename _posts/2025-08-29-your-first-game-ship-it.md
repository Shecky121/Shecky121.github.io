# Your First Game: How to Plan, Design, and Actually Ship It

*Updated 2025-08-29*

## Pick a tiny scope
One‑screen arcade game (Pong/Breakout). Define the core loop and aim to finish in a week.

## One‑page GDD
- Pitch
- Core loop
- Win/lose
- Content (3–5 types)
- Milestones

## Choose an engine
- Godot — https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html
- Unity — https://unity.com/learn/get-started
- Unreal Engine — https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/get-started

## Seven‑day build loop
1. Input + movement
2. Obstacles + collisions
3. Scoring + UI
4. Juice pass
5. Balance + bug fixes
6. Menu + save high score
7. Build + upload to itch.io

## TL;DR
- Finish something tiny fast.
- Use the engine you’ll open daily.
- Prototype → juice → build → upload.
