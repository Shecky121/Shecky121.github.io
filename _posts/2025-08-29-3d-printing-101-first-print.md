# 3D Printing 101: Choosing a Printer, Materials, and Making Your First Print

*Updated 2025-08-29*

## FDM vs. Resin (SLA)
**FDM** is cheaper/cleaner to learn; **resin** has higher detail but more safety steps.

## Picking your first FDM printer
- Auto bed leveling, direct drive, PEI bed, active community.
- Parts availability and support trump raw specs.

## Filaments
- **PLA** — easy, rigid; ~190–220 °C nozzle, 45–60 °C bed.
- **PETG** — tougher; 220–250 °C nozzle; tune retraction to reduce stringing.

## Your first print
1. Square frame; auto-level; set Z‑offset.
2. Slice a calibration cube at 0.2 mm, ~20% infill.
3. Watch the first layer, then iterate one variable at a time.

## TL;DR
- Start with FDM + PLA.
- Nail bed leveling and Z‑offset.
- Switch to PETG for stronger parts; tune temps/retraction.
